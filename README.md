An Odin Project foundations project

#In this project, I will attempt to recreate an example webpage from images provided by the Odin Project that provide layout, fonts, and colors. I will subtitute my own content based off of one of my ideas for a website.

How do I get a blue border to show up around my images if I want that?

How do I get rounded edges on my buttons and call to action section?

How do I get a white border around my call to action button?
