An Odin Project foundations project

#In this project, I will attempt to recreate an example webpage from images provided by the Odin Project that provide layout, fonts, and colors. I will subtitute my own content based off of one of my ideas for a website.

Questions:

How do I take off the border and radius on just one of my img's? Essentially, how do I separate styling between my img's?

Things to do:

Make "Thor" more bold than the rest of the quote text, and make the quote text less bold.
